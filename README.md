# CoachingBuddy
As a rower, I always want to see how I improve throughout my training, but with a simple google sheet or excel doc, there leaves so much to be desired. As I started coaching, I wanted a way to quickly store, view, and track the impacts of workouts in a way more organized way than I used to be able to.
Enter Coaching Buddy. All the functionality of a spreadsheet and all the power of a data analyzer plus other features that are helpful for coaches
